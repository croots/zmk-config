My personal configuration for ZMK

Initial repo set up using the standard ZMK pipeline. Flake based off of  lilyinstarlight/zmk-nix

Run `nix run .#update` to update West dependencies, including ZMK version, and bump the `zephyrDepsHash` on the derivation.

`nix build` generates the firmware files. Mostly useful to make sure the build doesnt fail ahead of time

`nix run .#update` to automatically flash the firmware following the terminal prompt

This uses urob's timerless setup to help with home row mods as well as code from urob/zmk-helpers
